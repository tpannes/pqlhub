Hi there. 
My name is Timo Pannes, I am Senior Architect for ECM & Output Management at a large health insurace company in Germany.
I have been working as international IT-consultant for ISIS Papyrus Software for more than 10 years.


This is a collection of PQL scripts that I created over the years and which I find useful, so I wanna share it with you.
For those who don't know Papyrus, check out their website https://www.isis-papyrus.com.

The ISIS Papyrus platform integrates two scripting languages called Docdef and PQL (Papyrus Query Language) which serve different purposes. Docdef is a document definition language which is compiled by Papyrus DocEXEC formatter to create AFP documents.

PQL is used to control pretty much all other aspects of the platform, it's the glue between the various predefined components like Agents, Queues, Adapters, etc. that are part of Papyrus Objects.
You can use it to automate things in your workflows, to design your own class methods, to build data interfaces for your EyeWidget UIs, to interact with Papyrus Objects from Docdef code and much more.

There is no manual for the scripts as of now, so the only thing that might help are scripts headers and comments in the code. 
Have a look what it's there and if you find something useful or spot a bug, I would be more than happy to hear from you.
