Hi there. 
My name is Timo Pannes, I am senior architect for ECM & Output Management at a large health insurace company in Germany.
I have been working as international IT-consultant for ISIS Papyrus Software for more than 10 years.


This is a collection of PQL scripts that I found useful over the years, so I wanna share it with you.
For those who don't know Papyrus, check out their website https://www.isis-papyrus.com

The ISIS Papyrus platform integrates two scripting languages called Docdef and PQL (Papyrus Query Language) which serve different purposes. Docdef is a document definition scripting language which then used by Papyrus DocEXEC formatter to create AFP documents.

PQL is used to control pretty much all other aspects of the platform, its like the glue between all the predefined components like Agents, Queues, Adapters, etc. that are provided out of the box.
You can use it to automate things in your workflows, to design your own class methods, to build data interfaces for UIs, interact with Papyrus Objects from Docdef code. and much more.

So have a look what its there and if you find something useful (or find a bug), I would be more than happy to hear from you:
